In passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon by the verb. It is often used when the doer of the action is unknown or unimportant. For example: 'The meal was cooked by the chef.'

It enhances the reader's experience by making the scene more immersive and engaging.

Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in nearby words, often used to create internal rhyming within phrases or sentences. For example: 'The early bird catches the worm,' where the 'e' sound is repeated. Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds, typically at the end of words, but it can also occur in the middle. For example: 'The lumpy, bumpy road,' where the 'm' and 'p' sounds are repeated. Both devices add musicality and rhythm to writing."

Coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) connect elements of equal importance, such as in the sentence 'She wanted to go to the party, but she had to finish her homework first.' Subordinating conjunctions (because, although, since, unless) connect dependent clauses to independent clauses, as in 'She went to the store because she needed milk.'

The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and is connected to the independent clause by a subordinating conjunction (because, although, since, etc.). For example, 'Although it was raining, we decided to go for a hike.' In this sentence, 'Although it was raining' is the dependent clause, and 'we decided to go for a hike' is the independent clause."

'Fewer' is used with countable nouns, things that can be counted individually. For example, 'There are fewer apples in the basket than yesterday.' On the other hand, 'less' is used with uncountable nouns, things that cannot be counted individually. For example, 'There is less water in the bottle than before.' A helpful way to remember the difference is that 'fewer' refers to number, while 'less' refers to amount."

It cannot stand alone as a sentence and depends on an independent clause to give it meaning. Dependent clauses often begin with subordinating conjunctions like 'because,' 'although,' 'if,' or 'when.' For example, in the sentence 'When the rain stopped, we went outside,' the dependent clause is 'When the rain stopped,' and it depends on the independent clause 'we went outside' to form a complete sentence."

A strong concluding sentence often restates the topic sentence in a different way or offers a final thought related to the main idea. For example, in a paragraph about the benefits of reading, a concluding sentence might be: 'Overall, reading not only enhances knowledge but also provides a great source of entertainment.' This helps to reinforce the central idea and leave the reader with a clear understanding of the paragraph's purpose."

Interjections are usually followed by an exclamation point or a comma, depending on the intensity of the emotion. For example, 'Wow!' expresses surprise, and 'Oh, I didn't see you there,' expresses a mild surprise or realization. Interjections can stand alone or be inserted into a sentence, and they add emotional nuance to written and spoken language."

The most common coordinating conjunctions are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so, often remembered by the acronym FANBOYS. For example, in the sentence 'I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining,' the coordinating conjunction 'but' connects the two independent clauses 'I wanted to go for a walk' and 'it started raining.' Coordinating conjunctions help to create compound sentences and ensure that the elements they connect are balanced and clear."

'Lie' is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object, and it means to recline or be in a horizontal position. The principal parts of 'lie' are 'lie' (present), 'lay' (past), and 'lain' (past participle). For example, 'I lie down every afternoon,' and 'Yesterday, I lay down for a nap.' On the other hand, 'lay' is a transitive verb, meaning it requires a direct object, and it means to place or put something down. The principal parts of 'lay' are 'lay' (present), 'laid' (past), and 'laid' (past participle). For example, 'I lay the book on the table,' and 'She laid the keys on the counter.' Remember, 'lie' is something you do yourself, and 'lay' is something you do to something else."

It often involves a contrast between appearance and reality. There are three main types of irony: verbal irony, situational irony, and dramatic irony. An example of situational irony is: 'A fire station burns down.' This is ironic because one would expect a fire station to be the last place to catch fire. An example of verbal irony is: 'Oh, great! Another homework assignment,' where the speaker actually means the opposite of what they are saying, expressing frustration rather than enthusiasm."

An 'allusion' is a reference to something well-known, such as a person, event, place, or work of art, often used to enhance the meaning or context of a situation. For example, saying 'He met his Waterloo' is an allusion to Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, implying that someone has faced a significant and final defeat. On the other hand, an 'illusion' is a false perception or a deceptive appearance, often creating a misleading impression. For example, 'The magician created the illusion of a disappearing act,' where 'illusion' refers to a trick that deceives the audience into seeing something that isn't real."

For example, in the sentence 'My brother, a skilled guitarist, is performing tonight,' the appositive 'a skilled guitarist' provides more information about 'my brother.' An essential appositive is necessary for the meaning of the sentence and is not set off by commas.

Themes can be broad and universal, such as love, friendship, courage, or betrayal, and they are often explored through the characters, plot, and settings. For example, in Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' one of the major themes is the injustice of racial prejudice and the importance of moral integrity.

Subordinating conjunctions, such as 'because,' 'although,' and 'since,' connect a dependent clause to an independent clause.

'Who' is used as the subject of a sentence or clause, while 'whom' is used as the object of a verb or preposition. For example, 'Who is coming to the party?' uses 'who' as the subject. In contrast, 'To whom did you give the book?' uses 'whom' as the object of the preposition 'to'. Another example: 'She is the one who called you' versus 'She is the one whom you called.'"

It means using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level of importance. Parallel structure can occur at the word, phrase, or clause level. For example, 'She likes hiking, biking, and swimming' uses parallel structure with the '-ing' form of the verbs. Another example is 'He wanted to learn more about cooking and baking,' which maintains parallelism with the gerunds 'cooking' and 'baking'."

It is used to make descriptions more vivid and imaginative. For example, 'Her smile was as bright as the sun' and 'He ran like the wind' are similes. Another example is 'The ice cream was as cold as ice,' which compares the ice cream to ice to emphasize its coldness."

For example, 'Please pass me the salt' refers to a specific salt that is known to both people. The indefinite articles 'a' and 'an' are used to refer to nonspecific or general nouns. 'A' is used before words that begin with a consonant sound, and 'an' is used before words that begin with a vowel sound. For example, 'I saw a movie' and 'She wants an apple' are general references to any movie and any apple, respectively."

Each independent clause in a compound sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. For example, 'I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining' is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction 'but'.

Dependent clauses typically begin with subordinating conjunctions like 'because,' 'since,' 'if,' 'when,' or 'although.' For example, in the sentence 'Because it was raining, we stayed inside,' the clause 'Because it was raining' is a dependent clause. Another example is 'She was happy when she saw the gift,' where 'when she saw the gift' is a dependent clause."

The past tense of 'lay' is 'laid.' For example, 'She laid the book on the table yesterday.' 'Lie' is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. For example, 'I need to lie down.' The past tense of 'lie' is 'lay.' For example, 'He lay down for a nap earlier.' Remember, 'lay' needs an object, while 'lie' does not."
